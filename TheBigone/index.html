     <div class="about">Daily there are presented to us endless choices. This can be seen in our spotless vinyl collections, monochrome outfits, and our spotless white sneakers.  I cannot speak to other generations, but my generation struggles with understanding boundaries. Blame it on ADD, on Instagram, on binge watching TV. It becomes about discipline, and when to know how to say no. When to know how to choose less. This concept applies to all areas of our lives; but for me, specifically, I've been searching for a balance, between minimalism and luxury. But not luxury in the sense of marble floors or cigars on ice. Luxury in a more refined sense. The type of luxury that appeals to a man's morning routine, the pleasures in life that can be found in the small details; as oneâ€™s taste in shaving cream. Nothing loud, or overproduced, but simply finding appreciation in a world lacking in knowing when enough is enough or too much. </div>
