    <h1>MURU</h1>
  <div id="parallax-bg-3" class="parallax-bg">
		<div id="bg-3-1"></div>
		<div id="bg-3-2"><a>Living rooms have become dated. For some this may be from the fact we live in 500ft studios or because we live with so many people everything blends together. Either position we find ourselves at, living rooms contain history for all of us. For me, a living room is similar to what a white picket fence is to most- a symbol of happiness. MURU is defined as 1. A crumble 2. A very small amount of something.</a><br /><br /><br /><br />
      <a> MURU is concerned with you being concerned about your customer responsibility. Thus, "More isn't always better" is their slogan of sorts. Creator and founder Heidi explains, "I think that's what's so interesting about designing around a material like wax is. It's perceived in a very traditional application and shape - and nothing really pushes its boundaries from a pillar to a taper.” Heidi was able to use the limitations of wax and construct different forms to explore and re-evaluate the best characteristics. This can be seen in all four candles of the collection. For me, I focused on pule as I saw it as a centerpiece. It was not the first to sell out, but it's still a bestseller. It's simple, but not basic- elegant but understated, full of self confidence in a way that makes other candles rather dull. MURU is breaking apart previous dispositions of what a candle is as opposed to an industry of design that believes (the idea) “more is better.”</a><br /><br /> <br /> 
                <a> In a culture where we are constantly looking for happiness and too often replacing most of our problems with products. I can't say MURU will bring you happiness, but I can tell you it won't bring you more clutter. And for a lot of us, sometimes, that's a start to our white picket fence. </a><br /><br /><br /></div>
